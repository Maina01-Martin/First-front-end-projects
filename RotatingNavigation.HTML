        <h1>The Psychology Of Home</h1>
  </header>
        <p> There is a reason why the first thing we often ask someone when we meet them,
            right after we learn their name,is "<i>Where do you live?"</i>" Susan Clayton ,an enviromental
            pyschologist at the college of Wooster says that for many people, their home is part of their
            self-definition,which is why we do things like decorate our houses and take care of our lawns.</p>
    
        <p>But while it's human nature to have a place to belong, we also want to be special and defining yourself
            with something about a place might just do that.You might also choose to identify yourself as a Person
            who once lived somewhere because it makes you distinctive.

        <p>The meaning of a person's home is enriched with memories."There is a pretty strong evidence that the environment
            in which people live is closely linked to their well-being," says Graham Rowles,a gerontology professor at the 
            University of Kentucky.Creating a home is frequently such a demanding process because it requires us to find
            our way to objects that can correctly convey our identities.Wherever we go, no matter how many hotels or 
            public spaces we visit,we typically feel a powerful ache to return to our own furnishings,an ache that has
            little do with the material comfort per se.</p>
